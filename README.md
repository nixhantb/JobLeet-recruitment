# Introduction

> **Not just another job board.**
> **JobLeet finds real, high-fit talent and filters out the AI hijacked noise.**



## ‚ùó The Problem Today

Modern recruitment is broken.

* **Resume spam is rampant** , most are AI-written, buzzword-stuffed, or misrepresent actual skill.
* **Cultural misalignment** causes high turnover, recruiters are left guessing at behavior and fit.
* **Traditional job boards overwhelm**  quantity over quality, and no insight into who‚Äôs real.

Recruiters don‚Äôt need more applicants.
They need **clarity**, **truth**, and **fit** ‚Äî before wasting hours screening.
